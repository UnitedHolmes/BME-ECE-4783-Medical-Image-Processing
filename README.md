Instructions to Run the GUI

Please always open “Module3_GUI.m” in Matlab and click the green button “RUN” or press keyboard button “F5” to run the GUI. Do NOT try to run “Module3_GUI.fig”. It simply doesn’t work. 

Do NOT delete “Module3_GUI.fig”!

Please follow the steps below to use “Module3_GUI.m”:
1.	If you have never selected any input image, please start from selecting the input image. 
2.	If you have not selected any classifier, please select one. If you fail to do so, an error message will appear at the location of prediction results.
3.	Click “Ramblin On !!!” to show the prediction result and performance metrics. 
4.	You can compare the actual image class with the prediction result by looking at the top mid. If the prediction matches the actual class, a photo of buzz and Yuanda will appear at the right bottom corner and the message "Yes, we have made it!" will show up; otherwise, you will see a photo of Yuanda in white suit and the message "Wait, we have got a problem!". You can also find the performance metrics at bottom left. 
5.	You can choose a different classifier without chaning the input image and click on "We are graduating in x day(s)!" to see the new prediction result and new performance metrics. 
6.	You can choose a different input image by clicking "Select Input Image". You can stay with your previously chosen classifer without changing it or select a different one, and click "Ramblin On!!!" to see new results.
7.	Please enjoy our GUI and give all of us congraduations towards our graduation.
8.	Thanks for your guidance, time and effort the entire semester!
